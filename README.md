 # Hey, this is Vinayak :nerd_face:

I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working at [Aganitha](https://github.com/aganitha) contributing to in-silico solutions for drug discovery.

- Love working with frontend tech. React is something I enjoy but its not the right choice everytime.
- Elixir is something I'm going through these days. Its awesome! The [Phoneix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework is really well built.
- React Native is another framework is love working with. Checkout the [animations](https://github.com/vinayakmalviya/reanimated-playground) I created in React Native using [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- Always looking to collaborate across a wide stack of tech - **TypeScript**, **Elixir**, **Python**, even **Rust** (I'm a real novice tho). Open to solve any challenges and problems regardless of the language.
- Playing around on Figma, exploring designs is always fun to catchup on.
- Available at [malviyavinayaks@gmail.com](mailto:malviyavinayaks@gmail.com) and **vinayakm** on Discord.
- F1 and HIMYM are my comfort zones, never leaving those :face_in_clouds:
