 # Hey, this is Vinayak :nerd_face:

:wave: I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working at [Aganitha](https://github.com/aganitha) contributing to in-silico solutions for drug discovery.

### About me

- :yellow_heart: Love working with frontend tech. React is something I enjoy but its not the right choice everytime.
- **`Elixir`** is something I'm going through these days. Its awesome! The [Phoneix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) framework is really well built.
- :iphone: React Native is another framework is love working with. Checkout the [animations](https://github.com/vinayakmalviya/reanimated-playground) I created in React Native using [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- Always looking to :handshake: collaborate across a wide stack of tech - **`TypeScript`**, **`Elixir`**, **`Python`**, even **`Rust`** (I'm a real novice tho). Open to solve any :military_helmet: challenges and problems regardless of the language.
- Playing around on :art: Figma, exploring designs is always fun to catchup on.
- Available at :email: [malviyavinayaks@gmail.com](mailto:malviyavinayaks@gmail.com) and :computer: **vinayakm** on Discord.
- :racing_car: F1 and HIMYM are my comfort zones, never leaving those :face_in_clouds:
